# Active Event Stack Lite

It's a fork of [qimingweng/active-event-stack](https://github.com/qimingweng/active-event-stack) with heavy dependencies removed. 

See details in [source](https://github.com/qimingweng/active-event-stack/issues/1) [repo](https://github.com/qimingweng/active-event-stack/pull/2).

It seems that source project is abandoned and there is no hope that PR will be merged. Still, I'm not happy to have 540kb of useless dependencies in my bundle. So this fix is published as different package.
